# Standardized Elements

The public sharing for these wireframes is:

[https://balsamiq.cloud/srj76i4/p3l8wr](https://balsamiq.cloud/srj76i4/p3l8wr)

While these are designed here in Balsamiq, we highly suggest that the components be translated into Material-UI React components, found here: [https://react-material-kit.devias.io/browse](https://react-material-kit.devias.io/browse).

The items presented here are used and re-used throughout the system, and therefore, are presented as such.

## Standardized Jump to & add/delete buttons

A small, colorized right-facing arrow \(\) indicates a hyperlink to the related record it is on. Large, colorized minus \(-\) and plus \(+\) signs appearing next to each other indicate that the record in question can be deleted \(minus, -\) or a new record can be added \(plus, +\).

## Standardized deletion message

When a record is being deleted, prior to deletion a standardized dialog will appear double-checking with the end user to determine if the record should _really_ be deleted.

## Standardized Required Field error message

Any time a record is being created or modified, the system must check for required fields to be filled out \(and sometimes filled out correctly\). When a required field is _not_ filled out, or done so correctly, a standardized message emanating from the **Save**, **Continue**, or other button will appear listing the fields to be reviewed.

Along with that, the field\(s\) in question will be highlighted in red to give the end users another visual presentation of which field\(s\) need to be reviewed.
