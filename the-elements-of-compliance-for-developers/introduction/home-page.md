# Home Page

The public sharing for these wireframes is:

[https://balsamiq.cloud/srj76i4/p8hj40e](https://balsamiq.cloud/srj76i4/p8hj40e)

While these are designed here in Balsamiq, we highly suggest that the components be translated into Material-UI React components, found here: [https://react-material-kit.devias.io/browse](https://react-material-kit.devias.io/browse).

## Home page

We donâ€™t have much for the design of the home page, other than that it should have some basic information about Compliance as Code, how to contact members of the organization, how to get support, and login/signup links.

### More Info

Somehow we should communicate to those _not_ signed up, what all of the logos mean and how much _depth of information and assistance_ there is on the site. One way to possibly do this would be to have a roll-over of information available for each icon, as shown below.
