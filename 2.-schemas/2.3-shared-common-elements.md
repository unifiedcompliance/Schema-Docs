# § 2.1 Common Schema Elements

Many schema items are reusable throughout the schema, such as the CoreMetaData that is found within _most_ of the other schema elements. We will present these first.

## § 2.1.1 CoreMetaData

Metadata documenting the ID and core information about a JSON Thing. Both **date\_created** and **date\_modified** are in the _**date**_ format specified by the manual of style [HERE](https://stylemanual.grcschema.org/overarching-styles/language-and-voice/define-number-formatting#define-the-styles-for-date-and-datetime-fields).

| **Property** | **Expected Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| checksum | Integer | A checksum calculated using Verhoeff calculations based on 'date\_modified', 'id', and 'live\_status'. |
| created\_audit\_id | Integer | The ID of audit record holding the created data. |
| date\_created | Date | The date the record was created. |
| date\_modified | Date | The date the record was created. |
| live\_status | Boolean | A Boolean field of "live" \(1\) or "deprecated" \(0\). |

This value will be returned in the response body for the object instance allowing you to identify the record using your key. A locally-unique, 16-byte string is recommended. The data in this property should be considered transient. |
